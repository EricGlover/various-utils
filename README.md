Various explorations of CS basics, some math and some scripts I find personally useful. Nothing important here.

As of 10/16/17 the more interesting contents are such:

There's a class dealing with prime numbers

A file dealing with sequences 

Some JS Data Structure Implementations (Stack, Queue, Hash, Adjacency List, etc..)

and a Ruby function looking for perfect nth roots (don't remember if it works though...)
