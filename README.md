Various explorations of CS basics, some math and some scripts I find personally useful. Nothing important here.

As of 8/28/17 the more interesting contents are such:
There's a class dealing with prime numbers
A file dealing with sequences 
and a Ruby function looking for perfect nth roots (don't remember if it works though...)
